                    <div class ="half-width">
                        <p>My journey into molecular biology started in 2010, when I was studying medical genetics during my 4th year in
                            Saint Petersburg State Medical Academy. I quickly became fascinated by the concept of polymerase chain reaction, its simplicity and endless possibilities. 
                            Experience with sequencing and fluorescence <em>in situ</em> hybridization followed soon.</p>

                    <div class ="half-width">
                        <p>That fascination opened a door that could never be shut. Since then I have developed an interest in   
                            cutting edge biomedical research. I have implemented PCR as a method of detecting infectious agents in the
                        clinical laboratory where I was employed in 2016-2018. I also enjoyed sharing my experience and knowledge 
                    with students while I was teaching at the local medical institute.</p>
